Error Documentation: login.ejs

This document outlines the errors introduced in the login.ejs file.
Two specific errors were deliberately introduced.

Error 1: Incorrect Action Attribute

Description: In the login form,the action attribute is set to  (action="/login-bug"), which is incorrect. : line 31
This action attribute should point to the route responsible for handling the login form submission.

Example of error:
<form action="/login-bug" method="post">


Error 2: Duplicate ID Attribute

Description: Both the password input field and its label have the same ID attribute ("password") : line 38, line 39.
The JavaScript functions will now be targeting the wrong element or CSS styles.

Example of error:
<label for="password" class="form-label text-dark" id="password">Password</label>
<input type="password" class="form-control" id="password" name="password" required>


Resolution to correct errors:

To resolve these errors:

1. Update the action attribute in the form to point to the correct route for handling login form submissions:

Correction
<form action="/login" method="post">

2. Ensure that each element in the HTML document has a unique ID Attributes to avoid conflicts. Update one of the elements to have distinct ID:

Correction
<label for="passwordLabel" class="form-label text-dark" id="passwordLabel">Password</label>
<input type="password" class="form-control" id="passwordInput" name="password" required>


Tools and Process for Debugging

To debug and resolve these issues, the following tools and processes can be used:

1. Visual Inspection, by manually reviewing the HTML code in login.ejs to identify the errors.

2. Browser Developer Tools: Use the browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to inspect the HTML structure, or view console logs to debug html or JavaScript code.

3. Console Output: Print debug messages or errors to the console using JavaScript to identify any runtime issues.

4. HTML Validator: Utilize online HTML validation tools to check for syntax errors and ensure compliance with HTML standards.

5. Code Linting: Enable code linting in the text editor or IDE to identify potential syntax errors and enforce coding conventions.

By following these debugging practices and utilizing appropriate tools, the errors in the login.ejs file can be identified and resolved efficiently.
